*DESCRIPTION* : This task demonstrates how to collect real-time data from an online API and turn it into visual graphs. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, the Python program requests weather information such as temperature, humidity, and forecast times for a specific city. The API returns this information in JSON format. The data is then processed using the pandas library, which converts the raw JSON response into a clean and organized table (DataFrame). This makes it easier to select the required fields, handle date-time values, and prepare the data for analysis. Finally, the organized data is visualized using Matplotlib (or Seaborn). The program plots simple graphs, such as temperature vs. time or humidity vs. time, helping to clearly observe weather trends. Overall, the task covers three key steps: (i) Fetching data from an API (ii) Cleaning and structuring it (iii) Displaying it through meaningful visual plots.
